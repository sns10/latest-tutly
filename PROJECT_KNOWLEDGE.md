## 1. Architecture Overview

### Platform Type
Multi-tenant SaaS for tuition center management built with **React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Lovable Cloud (Supabase)**.

### Role Hierarchy
```
Super Admin → Tuition Admin → Student / Parent (portal)
```

### Data Isolation
Every data table has a `tuition_id` foreign key + RLS policies ensuring complete tenant isolation.

### Authentication
- Supabase Auth with `user_roles` table using `app_role` enum: `super_admin`, `tuition_admin`, `student`, `parent`
- Portal users: shared email per tuition OR individual student accounts
- Login rate limiting via `useLoginRateLimit` hook

---

## 2. Tech Stack & Key Dependencies

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite 5, TypeScript 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 3, shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) |
| State | @tanstack/react-query v5 (cached, optimistic) |
| Routing | react-router-dom v6 (lazy-loaded pages) |
| Backend | Lovable Cloud (Supabase) — DB, Auth, Edge Functions, Storage |
| Charts | Recharts |
| PDF/Excel | jsPDF, xlsx, html2canvas |
| Forms | react-hook-form + zod validation |
| PWA | vite-plugin-pwa + service worker |

---

## 3. Routing & Navigation

### App.tsx Structure
```
QueryClientProvider → BrowserRouter → AuthProvider → SidebarProvider
  ├── AppSidebar (desktop, feature-gated menu items)
  ├── BottomNav (mobile: Home, Board, Schedule, Reports)
  └── Routes:
      ├── /auth → AuthPage (public)
      ├── /privacy, /terms → Legal pages (public)
      ├── /register/:tuitionSlug → Student self-registration (public)
      ├── /super-admin → SuperAdmin (super_admin only)
      ├── /student → Student portal (student/parent/portal users)
      └── /* → Index.tsx (tuition_admin) with nested sub-routes:
          ├── / → Dashboard
          ├── /tests, /students, /classes
          ├── /attendance, /fees, /timetable, /materials
          ├── /leaderboard, /reports
          └── All feature-gated via FeatureGate component
```

### ProtectedRoute
- Role-based access + portal-user detection + tuition status enforcement
- Inactive/expired/suspended tuitions → blocked with `TuitionInactiveScreen`
- Uses React Query caching for role + portal checks (no redundant API calls)

---

## 4. Feature Tier System

Features are toggled per tuition by Super Admin. Gated via `FeatureGate` component and `isFeatureEnabled()` hook.

| Tier | Features |
|------|----------|
| **Core** | Attendance, Fees, Student Portal |
| **Standard** | Timetable, Materials, Homework, Announcements, Leaderboard, Gamification (XP) |
| **Premium** | Reports, Term Exams, Bulk Import, WhatsApp Alerts, Room Scheduling, Challenges |

Defined in: `src/hooks/useTuitionFeatures.ts` → `ALL_FEATURES` array

---

## 6. Key Hooks & Data Flow

### Domain Hook Architecture (Refactored April 2026)

All data fetching and mutations use **domain-specific hooks** in `src/hooks/queries/`. The old monolithic `useSupabaseData` hook is deprecated and unused.

| Hook File | Queries | Mutations |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `useCoreDataQuery.ts` | divisions, subjects, faculty, rooms, timetable, challenges, announcements, studentChallenges | — |
| `useStudentsQuery.ts` | students | addStudent (with auto-division + roll number), removeStudent |
| `useStudentMutations.ts` | — | updateStudent, assignEmail, assignTeam, updateDivision |
| `useAttendanceQuery.ts` | attendance, todayAttendance, historicalAttendance, reportAttendance, studentAttendance | markAttendance, bulkMarkAttendance |
| `useFeesQuery.ts` | fees (paginated), classFees, todayPayments, payments (paginated) | addFee, updateFeeStatus, deleteFee, recordPayment, updateClassFee |
| `useFeesMutations.ts` | — | addFeesBatch |
| `useTestsQuery.ts` | weeklyTests (paginated), testResults (paginated) | addWeeklyTest, deleteWeeklyTest, addTestResult, addTestResultsBatch |
| `useXpMutations.ts` | — | addXp, reduceXp, awardXp, buyReward, useReward |
| `useChallengeMutations.ts` | — | addChallenge, completeChallenge |
| `useAnnouncementMutations.ts` | — | addAnnouncement |
| `useFacultyMutations.ts` | — | addFaculty, updateFaculty, deleteFaculty |
| `useSubjectMutations.ts` | — | addSubject, updateSubject, deleteSubject |
| `useTimetableMutations.ts` | — | addTimetableEntry, updateTimetableEntry, deleteTimetableEntry |
| `useDivisionMutations.ts` | — | addDivision, updateDivision, deleteDivision |
| `useRoomMutations.ts` | — | addRoom, updateRoom, deleteRoom |

### Tuition Data Hooks
| Hook | Purpose | Cache |
|------|---------|-------|
| `useTuitionData` | Single query for all tuition fields | 10 min stale |
| `useTuitionInfo` | Derived from useTuitionData | shared cache |
| `useTuitionFeatures` | Derived from useTuitionData | shared cache |
| `useTuitionStatus` | Derived from useTuitionData | shared cache |
| `useUserRole` | React Query cached role fetch | 30 min stale |
| `useUserTuition` | Profile → tuition_id mapping | 30 min stale |

### Term Exam Data
| Hook | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `useTermExamData` | All term exam queries + mutations (paginated results) |

### Query Architecture
- Global `staleTime`: 5 minutes (set in App.tsx QueryClient)
- Global `gcTime`: 15 minutes
- Role/tuition data: 30 min stale (rarely changes)
- Feature flags: derived from shared tuition query (zero extra calls)
- **All large datasets use pagination loops** (no arbitrary `.limit()` caps)

### Performance Patterns
- Each page imports only its required domain hooks (no global re-renders)
- Chunked `.in()` filters for arrays > 200 items
- Paginated queries for fees, test results, payments, term exam results
- Explicit `tuition_id` filters on all queries
- Joined queries to reduce API calls (e.g., fees + payments)
- Fee status calculated from DB truth via `useRecordPaymentMutation`
- Optimistic mutations for attendance marking
- Virtualized lists for large student lists (`@tanstack/react-virtual`)

## 11. Recent Changes Log

### April 2026 — God Hook Refactor (Architecture)
- **Eliminated `useSupabaseData`**: Decomposed 972-line monolithic hook into 14 domain-specific hook files in `src/hooks/queries/`
- **Pages decoupled**: Each page (Index, Tests, Students, Fees, Attendance, Timetable, Classes, Leaderboard, Reports) now imports only its required hooks — no cross-domain re-renders
- **Facade deprecated**: `useSupabaseData.ts` reduced to thin re-export, marked `@deprecated`, unused by any component
- **Student logic consolidated**: Division auto-creation + roll number assignment moved into `useAddStudentMutation`

### April 2026 — Data Integrity Fixes (Pagination)
- **Payments query**: Removed `.limit(2000)` → paginated loop
- **Weekly tests query**: Removed `.limit(100)` → paginated loop
- **Test results query**: Raised safety cap from 5000 → 10000
- **Term exam results**: Removed `.limit(5000)` → paginated loop
- **Report attendance**: New `useReportAttendanceQuery` with on-demand fetch (no auto-fire)
- **Service worker**: Added cache-first strategy for static assets to prevent app hanging after WhatsApp share

### April 2026 — Fee Status Persistence Fix
- Migrated payment state from local `useState` to React Query (`usePaymentsQuery`, `useRecordPaymentMutation`)
- Fee status recalculated from DB truth after each payment, preventing stale-state overwrites

## 13. Important Rules for AI

1. **Never edit**: `client.ts`, `types.ts`, `config.toml`, `.env` — these are auto-generated
2. **RLS required** on all new tables (use `has_role()` and `get_user_tuition_id()`)
3. **Always include `tuition_id`** filters in queries for performance
4. **Use React Query** for all data fetching — no raw useEffect+useState for API calls
5. **Feature-gate** new features using `FeatureGate` component or `isFeatureEnabled()`
6. **Register new features** in `ALL_FEATURES` array in `useTuitionFeatures.ts`
7. **Chunk large operations** (300 per batch for upserts, 200 for `.in()` filters)
8. **Stay on React 18** — React 19 has breaking changes with current dependencies
9. **Keep `react-day-picker` at v8** — v9 requires shadcn calendar component rewrite
10. **Update this file** when making significant architectural changes
